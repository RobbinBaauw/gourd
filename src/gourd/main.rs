//! # `gourd`
//!
//! **`gourd`** is a command-line tool that schedules parallel runs for
//! algorithm comparisons.
//!
//! Given the parameters of the experiment, a number of test datasets,
//! and algorithm implementations to compare, `gourd` runs the experiment in
//! parallel and provides many options for processing its results.
//!
//! While originally envisioned for the DelftBlue supercomputer at
//! Delft University of Technology, `gourd` can replicate the experiment on
//! any cluster computer with the _Slurm_ scheduler, on any UNIX-like system,
//! and on Microsoft Windows.
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Verify that `gourd` is installed by running:
//! ```
//! $ gourd version
//! ```
//!
//! Congratulations! Now you can use `gourd`.
//!
//! There is extensive tutorials and documentation which can be accessed in many
//! different formats.
//!
//! As a manpage, with the `man` command:
//! ```
//! $ man gourd
//! $ man gourd.toml
//! $ man gourd-tutorial
//! ```
